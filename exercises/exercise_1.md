# ðŸ”Ž Inspect metabolic models and media file

While genome-scale metabolic models may appear complicated and mysterious, they exist in our computers as modest text files.

Analogous to the [HTML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) used to describe websites, the SBML format can be used to describe the metabolism of organisms.

Read about the [Systems Biology Markup Language](https://sbml.org/) (SBML) standard to familiarize yourself with the GEM format output of CarveMe. Use `less` to view the contents of your generated model, press the `q` key to stop viewing the file.

Search the [BiGG database](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/) to learn more about specific metabolites name and identifiers.
