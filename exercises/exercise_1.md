# üîé 1. Inspect the metabolic models

In case you are not already familiar with genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) and flux balance analysis (FBA), have a look through the following article:

* [Intro to FBA: What is flux balance analysis?](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.1614)

While genome-scale metabolic models may appear complicated and mysterious at first, they exist in our computers as modest text files. Analogous to the [HTML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) used to describe websites, the SBML format can be used to describe the metabolism of organisms.

* Read about the [Systems Biology Markup Language](https://sbml.org/) (SBML) standard to familiarize yourself with the GEM format output of CarveMe. 

The models we are using have been borrowed from the [materials of a manuscript-in-preparation](https://github.com/ChMaga/13C-proteomics). Both models were reconstructed using CarveMe and manually curated to study the *S. cerevisiae* <-> *L. lactis* metabolic interactions. You can have a look at the python scripts (e.g. [bacteria.py](https://github.com/ChMaga/13C-proteomics/blob/main/bacteria.py) and [yeast.py](https://github.com/ChMaga/13C-proteomics/blob/main/yeast.py)) to see how these models were manually curated.

# üó∫Ô∏è Explore the models visually

While this can be informative for some quick inspection, we may also visualize these metabolic models using web-based tools such as [fluxer](https://fluxer.umbc.edu/). Upload the bacteria and/or yeast model and have a look around!

# ü•´ Inspect the media composition

Use `paste` to view the contents of the `media.tsv` file

Search the [BiGG database](http://bigg.ucsd.edu/) to learn more about specific metabolites name and identifiers.

If you are feeling adventurous, come up with your own media composition/variation for simulation to be used in the following exercise! 

# üíé Discussion questions

* What are GEMs and how can they be used? What is FBA? What is SBML?
* How many reactions and metabolites are present in the yeast model? What about the bacterial model?
* How were these models reconstructed? To what extent is there metabolic compartmentalization?
* What classes of metabolites are present in the media compositions? What is different across the media variations?
* Is the yeast model gapfilled on a particular media?
* What compound does the BiGG ID `pnto__R` represent?
