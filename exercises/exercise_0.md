## üí≤ Running the code

In the following `.md` files, the dollar sign symbol within code chunks denotes lines of code that you should run in your terminal window, e.g.
```bash
$ echo "down here you can see the expected output of your commands"
down here you can see the expected output of your commands
```

Move into repo folder using `cd`
```bash
$ cd EMBOMicroCom
```

Set the variable `ROOT` as the root of your `EMBOMicroCom` repo 
```bash
$ ROOT=$(pwd)
```

To navigate to the root folder from your terminal from any directory
```bash
$ cd $ROOT
```

List contents of cloned repo using `ls`
```bash
$ ls $ROOT

## ü•õ Yeast - Lactic Acid Bacteria interactions

Familiarize yourself with the following case study involving *S. cerevisiae* and *L. lactis*:

* [Yeast Creates a Niche for Symbiotic Lactic Acid Bacteria through Nitrogen Overflow](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405471217303903)

In the following exercises, we will use a simple two-species system described in the above publication to model metabolic interactions. In particular, we will focus on the interactions between *L. lactis* and *S. cerevisiae*

## üíé Discussion questions

* Do you expect cross-feeding of metabolites between *S. cerevisiae* and *L. lactis*? If so, what metabolites?
* How do environmental media conditions influence metabolic interactions? Do you expect more or less interactions in rich vs minimal media?
